# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite) for details on supported features.

## Postgres db

- You'll need docker installed on your system

`docker pull postgres`
`docker run --name replimix-db -e POSTGRES_USER=docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`

- Update your .env DATABASE_URL to point to your running db, see the example.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
